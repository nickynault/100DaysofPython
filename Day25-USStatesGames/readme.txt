This project includes a csv, and creates a new one (not included here). If you run the code, play the game a bit, and then enter "Exit" or "exit", the game closes,
and creates a new csv filled with all the states you missed, to help you theoretically practice memorizing them better. If you hit cancel, the X, stop, etc., it just closes.
If you are wrong about an existing state, or spell things wrong, for now, it just closes.
